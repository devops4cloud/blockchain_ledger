# blockchain_ledger
The program is a simple blockchain based application that records the ledger records of amount of funds being sent, sender, adn reciever. It uses a front-end platform to interaction with the user to enter the transaction data. Then it creates a hash number to the transaction, and also validates the transaction by verifying its previous hash number. Thus, it helps create a block chain database named 'The PyChain Ledger'.
